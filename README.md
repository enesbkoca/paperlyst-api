### Microservice Folder Structure

Each microservice follows a standard folder structure containing the necessary files for building, running, and deploying the microservice. Below is an overview of the files you'll find in each microservice folder:

- **requirements.txt**: This file lists the dependencies required for the microservice. These dependencies are installed using a package manager like pip. Include the necessary libraries and frameworks required for your microservice to run, such as Flask, Kafka libraries, database connectors, etc.

- **Dockerfile**: The Dockerfile is used to build a Docker image for the microservice. It contains instructions for building the environment and packaging the application. This could include installing dependencies, copying source code into the image, setting environment variables, and defining the command to run the microservice.

- **service.py**: This file typically contains the main logic for the microservice. In the case of Flask-based microservices, it includes code to define and configure the Flask application, set up routes, handle HTTP requests, interact with databases or external services, etc.

- **controller.py**: This file contains the implementation of the business logic for the microservice. It includes functions or classes responsible for processing requests, interacting with data, performing business operations, and returning responses. Depending on the architecture of your microservice, you might have different controller files for different aspects of functionality.
